#This is a dictionary. It works a lot like a "list of lists" in that you can nest dictionaries
#inside of other dictionaries. What makes it different from lists is that it uses "keys" instead
#of index numbers. The keys are labels that you tie to a value.
neely_car_dictionary = {
    "brand" : "Mini",
    "model" : "Cooper",
    "year" : [2018, 2019, 2020]
}

#If you want to print the whole dictionary, print the name of the dictionary like you would a variable.
print(neely_car_dictionary)

#If you want to print a specific value, put the key inside of a box like you would pulling from a list.
print(neely_car_dictionary["brand"])

#If the value itself is a list, you put another box and call the index location like so.
print(neely_car_dictionary["year"][1])

#You can print just the keys from a dictionary using the keys function.
print(neely_car_dictionary.keys())

#You can print just the values from a dictionary using the values function.
print(neely_car_dictionary.values())


#You can put dictionaries inside dictionaries. This is called a nested dictionary.
#By doing this, you can organize values in a more robust way. Remember, you need to put the key
#names inside of quotes like a string, even if it's anotheer dictionary
fifth_hour_class = {
    "student_1" : {
        "Name" : "Wyatt",

#If you want to call the value of a key within a nested dictionary, use two boxes:
#1 with the name of the nested dictionary, 1 with the name of the key within the nested dictionary.
print(fifth_hour_class["student_2"]["Grade"])

#If you want to force change a key's value, just call the key and then have it equal the new value.
#However, this is a dirty way to do it that might cause issues.
fifth_hour_class["student_3"]["Sport"] = False
print(fifth_hour_class["student_3"]["Sport"])

#A cleaner way to do it is with the update function. Additionally, update allows you to add a new key
#and value to the dictionary.
fifth_hour_class["student_3"].update({"Name" : "Ethan Terrett"})
print(fifth_hour_class["student_3"])

#The pop function removes keys (and the values tied to it) for dictionaries as well.
fifth_hour_class.pop("student_1")
