#This is the random library. This allows us to do random choice and random number generation
#in python. The main three I want you to learn about is randint, choice, and shuffle.
import random


#The function "randint" provides a random integer between a range (X, Y) where
#X is the bottom of the range and Y is the top of the range.

#REMINDER: ALL functions from a library need to call the library to work. In this example,
#before we write "randint" we need to write "random."
d6 = random.randint(1,6)
print(d6)


#randint is ultimately an integer so you can do math with them accordingly.
d20 = random.randint(1,20)
d4 = random.randint(1,4)

d20plus4 = d20 + d4
print(d20, d4, d20plus4)

#The random function randomly generates a decimal between 0 and 1. This is useful
#for very precise randomness.
random_num = random.random()
print(random_num)
print(random_num + d20plus4)


#By that same logic, you can dump a bunch of randint into a list and it will generate a list of
#integers for you every time you run the code.
rand_num_list = [random.randint(1,6),random.randint(1,6),random.randint(1,6),random.randint(1,6),random.randint(1,6),]
print(rand_num_list)


#The function "choice" randomly chooses from a list just like one would blindly choose
#a colored ball from a bag or something of that nature.
class_num_list = [45, 27, 18, 25, 87, 0, 12, 14, 42, 7, 36, 74, 62, 11, 35, 15, 61]
class_num_choice = random.choice(class_num_list)
print(class_num_choice)


#The function "shuffle", just like your spotify playlist, randomly shuffles the objects inside
#of a list and if you were to print the whole list, it would be in a different order every time
#you run the code.
print(class_num_list)
random.shuffle(class_num_list)
print(class_num_list)
