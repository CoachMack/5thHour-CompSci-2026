#1. Import the "random" library
import random
#2. print "Hello World!"
print("Hello World!")
#3. Create three different variables that each randomly generate an integer between 1 and 10
a = random.randint(1,10)
b = random.randint(1,10)
c = random.randint(1,10)
#4. Print the three variables from #3 on the same line.
print(a,b,c)
#5. Add 2 to the first variable in #3, Subtract 4 from the second variable in #3, and multiply by 1.5 the third variable in #3.
a += 2
b -= 4
c *= 1.5
#6. Print each result from #5 on the same line.
print(a,b,c)
#7. Create a list containing four values that each randomly generate an integer between 1 and 6
rand_list = [random.randint(1,6),random.randint(1,6),random.randint(1,6),random.randint(1,6),]
#8. Sort the list in #7 and print it.
rand_list.sort(reverse=True)
print(rand_list)
#9. Add together the highest three numbers in the list from #7 and print the result.
rand_list_sum = rand_list[0] + rand_list[1] + rand_list[2]
print(rand_list_sum)
#10. Create a list with 5 names of other students in this class and print the list.
name_list = ["Neely", "Echo", "Santi", "Anthony", "Helber"]
print(name_list)
#11. Shuffle the list in #10 and print the list again.
random.shuffle(name_list)
print(name_list)
#12. Print a random choice from the list of names from #10.
print(random.choice(name_list))
